    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p><h3>Hey, my name is Matias Coiti√±o. I'm from Barcelona Spain. I have started this journey of learning how to program in 2024. I hope with this portfolio I will be able to land a Junior Developer position. I am a positive and friendly person. I like playing football, admiring mountains and beautiful landscapes.
         I also like eating desserts, maybe a little too much. That's why I also go to the gym to counter the calories!
         I have always been good with computers but for one reason or the other I ended up studying something else. So now while I am still young I decided to learn how to program finally.
         If you are an employer reading through this and you made it this far, please also have a look at my contact me page and call me for an interview. You won't regret it. Have a nice day!</h3></p>
